## Short Description:
This is a gym-related website project for a single person. A responsive, user-friendly website built using ReactJS Here, users can register by using their email and password. There are also Google Sign-In and Facebook Sign-In methods available for users. Although I used the Bootstrap CSS framework, I used Vanilla CSS to apply media queries to make the website more accessible to users on all devices.
